# SPSL

Sparky Shading Language. An experimental shading language that translates to HLSL or GLSL.


This is a work-in-progress project that aims to create a shading language with an object-oriented syntax. At the moment there are no plans to create a compiler to emit SPIR-V or DXIL bytecode. The current main goal is to translate to correct HLSL or GLSL (Vulkan) code.

The current language design is not final and thus is subject to changes at any time until a proper release.
